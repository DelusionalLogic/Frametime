FrameTime
=========

Measure the time your computer/application/monitor takes from receiving
a keypress to displaying something different.

How it works
------------

The hardware emulates a USB HID keyboard and a serial device. The serial device
is used for control signal to configure the measurement and start it. When the
measurement begins the device starts a timer and sends a keystroke. Using
a photodiode the device continously monitors the light level of the monitor for
some time while streaming the measurements and their timings over the serial
interface. When measurement is completed (after a set amount of time) the
device then sends a reset keystroke and emits a terminator on the serial bus.
The measurement can then be analyzed after the fact.

Hardware
-------

The inteded (and tested) hardware is a teensy2 with a SFH206K photodiode
connected between pin D4 and ground. Theoretically any atmega32u4 based
microprocessor should work.
